# Abhi — AI Automation Engineering Portfolio

I build production-grade AI automation systems for internal workflows: **rules + AI**, confidence scoring, and human-in-the-loop safeguards.

## Projects

### 1) Ticket Triage System (Rules + LLM)
**Problem:** Messy support tickets → structured, reliable decisions (category, priority, routing)
**Highlights:**
- Hybrid rules + LLM
- Confidence scoring + human review gate
- Audit trail (`rules_applied`) + explanation
- Stable output even when the LLM fails

**Tech:** Python, OpenAI (optional), deterministic rules engine

## What I’m focusing on
- Reliable AI automation systems (not demos)
- Explainability, fallbacks, and safety gates
- Clean documentation and maintainable code
